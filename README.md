# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction

Welcome to the Cryptocurrency Price Prediction repository! In this project, I've implemented various machine learning models to predict the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano based on their historical data from the past two years. The data was scraped from Yahoo Finance and used to train and evaluate the predictive models.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze the historical price data of three major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano) and develop predictive models to forecast their future prices. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and time series analysis techniques, we aim to create accurate predictions that can help investors and traders make informed decisions in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

## Key Features

1. **Data Scraping:** Utilized web scraping techniques to collect historical price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano from Yahoo Finance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted comprehensive EDA to understand the trends, patterns, and correlations in the cryptocurrency price data.

3. **Model Development:** Implemented various machine learning models, including:
   - XGBoost
   - Random Forests
   - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
   - SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors)
   - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
   - Regression Models

4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

5. **Price Prediction:** Generated predictions for future prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano based on the trained models.

6. **All-Time High/Low Analysis:** Calculated the all-time high, all-time low, and percentage increase for each cryptocurrency to provide additional insights.

## Usage

To replicate the project or explore the code, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

## Results and Insights

The project provides valuable insights into the historical price trends of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano, along with accurate predictions for their future prices. The trained models offer a predictive framework that can assist cryptocurrency investors and traders in making informed decisions.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate additional features and data sources for improved model performance.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters and explore advanced machine learning techniques.
- Deploy models as web services or applications for real-time price predictions.
- Conduct further research on sentiment analysis and external factors influencing cryptocurrency prices.
